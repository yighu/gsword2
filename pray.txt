Pray is the priviledge and duty of Christians. Spiritual life growth depends on prayers. Bible teaches us to pray constantly. Countless prayers are recorded in the Bible. God listens our prayers. Jesus Christ pray in heaven for us. But many Christians are not satisfied with their prayer life, even frustration. The good news is the Bible studying and prayers goes hand in hand. You must pray before studying Bible for the guidance of Holy Spirit and open our Spiritual eyes, so that we may see what God is saying to us. On the other hand, during Bible studying, The Word of God would inspire us. Some will reveal our sin, some open our eyes to see that people need God, some encourage us to have faith in God, some guide us to give thanks and worship God. All these can be brought before God in prayers. So there is a way of pray called Pray Scripture. It means to pray the Word of God back to God, at the same time the Word of God guide us what to pray, so we can bring our worship, pray, supplication and Thanksgiving to God. This is application is created based on this idea.
